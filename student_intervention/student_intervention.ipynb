    "#### Adaptative Boosting ####\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost (short name for Adaptative Boosting) algorithms can be used in various object recognition problems. The Viola-Jones face recognition algorithm is a variation of AdaBoost. It can also be used in text categorization and filtering problems.\n",

    "One of the weaknesses of AdaBoost is that it is sensitive to outliers, since it gives more weight to data that it classifies wrongly. This will eventually cause the model to overfit if there is enough noise in the data. The training time is also longer due to the fact that the algorithm uses several weak learners.\n",

    "The Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used in text and hypertext categorization, as well in image classification. It is also applied in biological and other sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of the SVMs is that they are resistant to overfitting. Also, due to the kernel trick, they can be used to classify non-linear data. It is also worth noticing that since the SVM is a result of an optimization problem, the results are guaranteed to be globally optimal, that is, the algorithm does not get stuck in an local optimal point. It also does well when the dataset has a number of dimensions higher than the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of the SVMs is that the results may be difficult to visualize compared to other algorithms, as the decision trees. It is not suited to larger data sets, as the training time tend to be high. It also tends to be less effective if the dataset is noisy and has too many overlapping classes.\n",
